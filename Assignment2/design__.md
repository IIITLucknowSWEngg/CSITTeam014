## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This **Software Design Documentation** outlines the comprehensive design structure of a PhonePe clone, focusing on digital wallet functionalities, payment processing, and related features. It ensures adherence to industry standards for system implementation and highlights how functional and non-functional requirements are addressed.

The document serves as a blueprint for all development stakeholders, ensuring scalability, security, and reliability of the platform. 

### 1.2 Scope

The PhonePe clone provides these primary features:  
- Digital wallets: Add, withdraw, and manage funds.  
- Payments: Transfers to users, merchants, and bill payments.  
- Recharge services: Mobile phones, DTH, and utility payments.  
- Investments: Mutual funds, insurance, and portfolio management.  
- Ticket bookings and other financial utilities.  

The design includes a **mobile application**, **backend systems**, and **API integrations** with third-party financial and service providers.

## 2. System Architecture

The system architecture is divided into three core layers:  
1. **Presentation Layer:** The mobile app's user interface.  
2. **Business Logic Layer:** Backend services for processing business logic.  
3. **Data Layer:** Database schemas, storage, and external API integrations.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements and Design Components

### 4.1 Scalability  
The system must handle high traffic, supporting **20,000 simultaneous users** efficiently.  

### 4.2 Security  
Robust protocols for **data encryption**, **multi-factor authentication**, and fraud detection.  

---

## 5. Module Design

### 5.1 Mobile Application (Frontend)

#### User Interface (UI)  
- **Features:** Wallet balance, recent transactions, payments, recharges, and investments.  

#### Controller Layer  
- Manages interactions and communications between the UI and the service layer.  

#### Service Layer  
- Processes backend communication, business logic, and validations.

---

### 5.2 Backend System

#### API Gateway  
Acts as the main entry point for the application, routing requests to appropriate backend services.  

#### Security Service  
- Provides data encryption, fraud detection, and secure communications.

---

## 6. Data Design

The database includes:  
- **Users:** Details like name, contact info, and preferences.  
- **Merchants:** Merchant details, ratings, and transaction history.  
- **Transactions:** Records of payer/payee details, amounts, and statuses.  

### Database Schema
