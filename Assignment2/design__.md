## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Design Document (SDD) provides the detailed design of the PhonePe clone, a digital wallet and payment application. It outlines the system architecture, components, interfaces, and interactions needed to ensure the implementation meets both functional and non-functional requirements. This document serves as a reference to the developers, designers, and stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of the application.

### 1.2 Scope
The PhonePe clone system is a comprehensive platform that allows users to:
- Create digital wallets
- Add and withdraw funds
- Transfer money to other users
- Make online payments
- Recharge mobile phones and DTH services

- Purchase insurance policies

The system includes the mobile application (frontend), backend services (server-side), payment processing, security features, and integration with various financial institutions and service providers.

### 1.3 Overview
This document includes a high-level design of the PhonePe clone system. It covers key components like the mobile application, backend API services, user authentication, transaction processing, payment gateways, and integration with external financial systems. Additionally, the document discusses scalability, security, and data management strategies to ensure a reliable, secure, and user-friendly application.
