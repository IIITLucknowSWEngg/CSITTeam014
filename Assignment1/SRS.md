## Understanding the Relationships

### Relationship Types Explained

#### C+ (Complementary)
- **Definition**: Requirements that positively reinforce each other
- **Example**: Modularity and Scalability complement each other as modular systems are easier to scale

#### O (Overlapping)
- **Definition**: Requirements that partially support or share common elements
- **Example**: Maintainability and Performance have overlapping concerns in system optimization

#### C (Conflicting)
- **Definition**: Requirements that negatively impact each other
- **Example**: Error Handling and Performance conflict as comprehensive error handling can slow system response

#### I (Independent)
- **Definition**: Requirements that have no direct impact on each other
- **Example**: Documentation and Performance have no direct influence on each other

### Key Matrix Insights

1. Most SE Guidelines are complementary (C+) to Security and Availability
2. Modularity shows strong complementary relationships with most NFRs
3. Error Handling has the most varied relationships across NFRs
