## **6. Methodology**  
The PhonePe Clone project will be executed using the **Agile development methodology**, following the **Scrum framework**. Agile ensures flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement.  

### **Key Agile Principles**  
- **Incremental Development**: Deliver small, functional pieces of the platform in each sprint.  
- **Frequent Delivery**: Release working versions of the platform at the end of every sprint.  
- **Collaboration**: Foster close collaboration between the development team, stakeholders, and users.  
- **Adaptability**: Respond to changing user needs and business requirements during development.  
- **Focus on Working Software**: Prioritize a working product over comprehensive documentation.  

### **Scrum Roles**  
- **Product Owner**: Defines the product vision, maintains the backlog, and prioritizes features.  
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum processes, resolves blockers, and promotes team efficiency.  
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional team responsible for coding, testing, and deployment.  

### **Scrum Events**  
- **Sprint Planning**: The development team and product owner plan tasks for the upcoming sprint.  
- **Daily Scrum**: Short, daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.  
- **Sprint Review**: Showcase the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.  
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Analyze the completed sprint to identify areas of improvement.  

### **Agile Artifacts**  
- **Product Backlog**: Centralized list of all product features, user stories, and improvements.  
- **Sprint Backlog**: Subset of the product backlog selected for completion during a sprint.  
- **Increment**: A functional, shippable product version delivered at the end of a sprint.
